# Marigold & Mango Leaf Toran – The Guardian of Your Threshold

## More Than Just Decoration
A Toran is not just a door hanging; it is a spiritual energy filter. According to Vastu Shastra, the main entrance (*Simha Dwara*) is where energy enters the home. Our Toran combines two powerful elements:
1.  **Mango Leaves:** Known to absorb negative ions and carbon dioxide, purifying the air and warding off *Drishti* (evil eye).
2.  **Orange Marigolds:** Representing the sun’s energy, joy, and the welcoming of Goddess Lakshmi.

## Authentic & Fresh
We do not use plastic or artificial leaves. Every Toran is hand-tied using fresh, green Mango leaves and bright, farm-fresh Marigolds on a sturdy natural fiber rope.

## Where to Use
* **Main Entrance:** To invite prosperity and good luck daily.
* **Pooja Room:** To mark the sacred boundary of your prayer space.
* **Office Inaugurations:** A must-have for new business beginnings to ensure success.
* **Festivals:** Essential for Diwali, Pongal, Varalakshmi Vratham, and Dussehra.

*Protect your home and invite abundance with our traditional Toran.*
