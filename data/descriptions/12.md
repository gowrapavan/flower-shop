# White Carnation Bulk Pack – Purity, Longevity, and Grace

## The Versatile Wonder
White Carnations are the unsung heroes of floral decoration. Known for their ruffled, ball-like appearance and a subtle, spicy clove scent, they symbolize pure love and good luck.

## Why Buy in Bulk?
* **Volume:** Carnations have large heads. A bunch of 50 stems covers a significant area, making them highly economical for large decorations.
* **Hardiness:** These are tough flowers. They withstand heat, wind, and handling better than roses or lilies, making them perfect for outdoor setups.

## Creative Applications
* **Flower Walls:** Their flat, wide shape makes them excellent for creating dense flower walls or carpets without gaps.
* **Car Decoration:** Because they don't wilt easily, they are the #1 choice for decorating wedding cars that will be driving in the sun and wind.
* **Peace & Remembrance:** White carnations are often used in memorials and prayer meets to signify peace and eternal love.
