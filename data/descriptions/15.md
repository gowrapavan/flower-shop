# Banana Stem (Vazhai Thandu) – The Symbol of Eternal Growth

## A Mandatory Auspicious Element
In South Indian weddings, the Banana Tree is not just a plant; it is a family member. Tying full Banana Stems with flower buds (*Vazhai Kula*) at the entrance of the marriage hall or house is a non-negotiable tradition.

## The Deep Symbolism
* **Regeneration:** The banana tree shoots up new pups from its roots continuously. It symbolizes the blessing that the couple's lineage should grow, flourish, and continue endlessly, generation after generation.
* **Prosperity:** Every part of the tree (fruit, flower, stem, leaf) is useful. It represents a life of abundance and usefulness to society.

## Our Promise
We deliver fresh, thick, and sturdy stems cut on the morning of your event. They are green, firm, and come with the flower bud intact—ensuring your entrance looks majestic and traditional.
