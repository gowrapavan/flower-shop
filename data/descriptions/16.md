# Rose Water Sprinkler (Paneer) – A Royal Welcome

## The Scent of Hospitality
In the heat of an Indian celebration, the first gesture of hospitality is the sprinkling of *Paneer* (Rose Water). It is an age-old tradition that serves a dual purpose: it physically cools the guest after their travel and spiritually cleanses the aura before entering the auspicious venue.

## Product Features
* **Authentic Distillation:** Our rose water is not just scented water; it is a hydrosol created from the steam distillation of real rose petals, capturing the true essence of the flower.
* **Traditional Vessel:** Comes in a classic sprinkler bottle designed for a fine, uniform mist—no large droplets to ruin makeup or clothes.
* **Pure & Safe:** Free from alcohol and artificial preservatives. It is safe if it accidentally touches the eyes or skin.

## Usage
Assign a family member or a welcome hostess to sprinkle this fragrant blessing on every guest as they step into the wedding hall or reception area.

*Start your celebration on a fragrant note.*
