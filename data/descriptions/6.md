# Jasmine (Mullai) Guest Garland – A Fragrant Gesture of Respect

## The Tradition of Welcome
In Indian culture, "Atithi Devo Bhava" (The Guest is God) is a guiding principle. There is no better way to honor this than with a fragrant Jasmine Garland. Light, elegant, and deeply aromatic, these garlands serve as a badge of honor for your special guests.

## Why Choose Mullai?
* **Unique Scent:** Unlike the overpowering scent of some flowers, Mullai has a sweet, calming, and earthy fragrance that relaxes the mind.
* **Lightweight:** Guests can wear these comfortably for hours without feeling the weight on their necks.
* **Elegance:** The alternating green stem and white bud pattern creates a natural, sophisticated look that complements any outfit.

## Perfect Occasions
* **VIP Welcomes:** Receiving dignitaries, chief guests, or corporate leaders.
* **Family Honors:** Giving special recognition to the uncles, aunts, and close relatives during a wedding.
* **Airport Welcomes:** A touching gesture for welcoming family members returning home after a long time.

*Make every guest feel like royalty with the timeless scent of Jasmine.*
