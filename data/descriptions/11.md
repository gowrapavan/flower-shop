# Orchid Stem Bunch (Purple) – Exotic Luxury

## A Touch of the Tropics
Move beyond the ordinary with our imported Purple Dendrobium Orchids. These flowers are symbols of rare beauty, luxury, and strength. Their unique, butterfly-like shape and vibrant violet-purple hue make them a showstopper in any arrangement.

## Longevity Like No Other
Orchids are famous for their shelf life. Unlike softer flowers that wilt in a day, cut orchids can look fresh for 1-2 weeks with proper care, making them an excellent investment for home decor or multi-day corporate events.

## Styling & Usage
* **Minimalist Decor:** Just 3-4 stems in a tall, slender vase create a high-end, modern look for your living room or office reception.
* **Bouquets:** They add an exotic flair and height to standard round bouquets.
* **Hair Accessories:** A single orchid bloom pinned to a bun is a classic, sophisticated look for receptions and cocktail parties.

## Care Tips
* Trim the bottom inch of the stem diagonally.
* Change the vase water every 2 days.
* Mist the petals lightly to mimic their humid natural environment.
