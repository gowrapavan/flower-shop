# Gajra (Crossandra/Kanakambaram) – The Fire of Tradition

## A Blaze of Color
In a sea of white Jasmine, be the one who stands out. Crossandra, locally known as *Kanakambaram*, is famous for its vibrant, fire-orange color. It is a staple in South Indian culture, representing energy, enthusiasm, and traditional femininity.

## Tradition Meets Style
* **The Contrast:** When braided along with white Jasmine (*Mullai*), the orange-white contrast is visually stunning and looks incredible on dark hair.
* **Sumangali Prarthanai:** It is the preferred flower for auspicious ceremonies involving married women, symbolizing the longevity of marriage.
* **Lightweight:** These flowers are paper-light. You can wear a thick strand all day without even feeling it.

## Shelf Life
Kanakambaram is incredibly resilient. It does not wilt quickly like Jasmine. It can stay fresh on your hair for the entire day, and even the next day, retaining its bright color even as it dries.

*Adorn your hair with the vibrant colors of culture.*
