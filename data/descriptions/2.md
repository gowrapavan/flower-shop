# Assorted Pooja Loose Flowers – A Basket of Devotion

## Why Buy Our Assorted Mix?
Imagine opening a box and being greeted by the divine fragrance of a temple at dawn. That is the experience our Assorted Pooja Loose Flowers provide. We don't just throw random leftover flowers into a bag; we curate a balanced, colorful, and fragrant mix designed specifically for daily worship (*Nitya Purasai*).

## What’s Inside?
* **Orange & Yellow Marigolds:** representing energy and the sun.
* **Paneer Roses:** For their intoxicating, cooling fragrance.
* **White Chrysanthemums/Jasmine:** Symbolizing purity and peace.
* **Vadamalli (Globe Amaranth):** For longevity and vibrant contrast.

## Perfect For Every Home
* **Daily Archana:** You no longer need to buy 5 different packets. One pack serves all your deities.
* **Kolam & Rangoli:** The loose petals are perfect for filling in designs at your doorstep, welcoming Lakshmi every morning.
* **Friday Pooja:** The abundance of flowers allows you to perform a grand offering without the hassle of market visits.

## Our Freshness Promise
We source directly from local farmers at 4 AM. The flowers are sorted, cleaned (no stems or leaves), and packed by 6 AM to reach you with the morning dew still fresh on their petals.
