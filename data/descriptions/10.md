# Pink Lotus for Pooja – The Sacred Seat of Lakshmi

## The Ultimate Divine Offering
The Lotus (*Kamalam*) is not just a flower; it is a symbol of spiritual enlightenment. Rooted in mud but rising above the water to bloom pure and unstained, it represents the detachment required for spiritual growth. It is the favorite seat of Goddess Lakshmi (Wealth) and Goddess Saraswati (Knowledge).

## When to Use?
* **Friday Pooja:** Offering a fresh pink lotus to Goddess Lakshmi on Fridays is believed to bring immense financial stability and abundance.
* **Diwali Lakshmi Pujan:** The most auspicious flower for the Festival of Lights.
* **Navagraha Shanti:** Used in rituals to appease the Sun God (Surya).

## Quality You Can Trust
Lotus flowers are delicate. We source ours from specific ponds where they are harvested carefully to ensure the petals do not shed. We deliver them with long stems so you can place them in a deep vessel (*Uruli*) with water, where they can stay fresh and open for 2-3 days.

*Invite the divine grace of Mahalakshmi into your home.*
