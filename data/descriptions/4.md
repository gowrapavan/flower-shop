# Tuberose Needle Garland – The Fragrance of Royalty

## The Art of 'Sampangi' Weaving
This is not your ordinary garland. The Tuberose Needle Garland is a masterpiece of South Indian floral art. Skilled artisans spend hours hand-threading individual Tuberose (*Sampangi*) buds using a specialized needle technique. This allows us to pack 3x more flowers per inch compared to standard tying methods, resulting in a thick, rope-like, luxurious finish.

## Why It’s the #1 Choice for Weddings
* **Intense Fragrance:** Tuberose is known as the "Mistress of the Night." Its sweet, heady perfume fills the entire wedding hall, announcing the couple's arrival before they are even seen.
* **Photogenic:** The dense white weave reflects light beautifully, making the couple look radiant in photos.
* **Durability:** Because of the tight weave, the garland holds its shape and stays fresh for 12-16 hours, enduring the heat of the ceremonial fire (*Agni*) without wilting.

## Use Cases
* **Muhurtham:** The perfect exchange garland (*Maalai Maatral*) for the main wedding ceremony.
* **Reception:** Adds a regal touch to suits and silk sarees.
* **Temple Processions:** Used to adorn the Utsava Murthy (processional deities) due to its grandeur.
